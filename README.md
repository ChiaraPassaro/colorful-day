# Colorful Day
## A bit of color always brightens up the day!

This experiment was born from the idea of cheering up a dull day.
Of course, my usual friends could not be missing: colors, cats, and dogs.
In reality, there are also some toothbrushes, perhaps because they are an integral part of the day and usually lend themselves to flashy colors.<br>
<br>
For this project, I used Vue 3, Typescript, SCSS.<br>
I also experimented with a different workflow by integrating the use of [Bing](https://www.bing.com/create) and [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.sh/).<br>
<br>
With Bing, I created images that I then reworked with Illustrator and converted into SVG.<br>
Cursor instead supported me in pair programming.<br>
<br>
After this usage experience, I can say that if you know what to ask and you have already written a good base of code, this IDE can be particularly useful especially for research, performing repetitive tasks, brainstorming.<br>
It can also be a faithful companion to improve execution speed and save the use of hands.

**Have a Colorful Day!**
